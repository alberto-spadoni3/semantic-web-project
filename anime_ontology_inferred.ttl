Armin Arlert is Eren's best friend. He is physically weak, but emotionally strong. Even though he lacks in actual combat skills, Armin is a genius in theoretical courses and can make plans even under extreme pressure. Even so, Armin keeps on thinking that he is weak. He himself does not notice the things he does for Eren and Mikasa and believes himself to be completely incompetent and hates himself for having to rely on Eren and Mikasa."""^^rdfs:Literal .

Bulma is originally a secondary main character, but her role is quickly downplayed as the series continues, even though she does remain an important support character for most of the series. Bulma is a direct parody of the character Xuanzang from the Chinese novel Journey to the West. Even though Bulma's character parodies a monk, her Japanese name \"Buruma\" is the brand of a popular gym short worn by girls in Japan. Her re-adapted name Bulma is a direct take on the word \"bloomers,\" which was a popular brand of women's underwear in the early 20th century.

Bulma is the second character to be introduced in the Dragon Ball series. In the early part of the story, she is the inventor of the Dragon Radar and is searching for the legendary Dragon Balls. Bulma was hoping to use the Dragon Balls to wish for the perfect boyfriend. While searching for a nearby Dragon Ball, she runs into Son Goku. It is at this time that she finds out Goku inherited one of the balls (the four-star ball) she is searching for from his Grandpa Gohan. Because of Goku's love for the ball and his belief that his Grandpa's spirit lives in the ball, Goku is not willing to give it up. Bulma then asks him to loan it for her in exchange of taking him in her travels. At that point, they team up to find the remainder of the balls and the adventure begins. In the later action-oriented episodes of the series, there is little room for a genius but Bulma continues to play a role as a secondary character, helping Goku and his friends with her gadgets, and having a rather rocky relationship with Yamcha.""" .

Eren is Shingeki no Kyojin's protagonist. His childhood friend, Mikasa, notes on numerous occasions that he acts on impulse without thinking things through, and she often pulls/carries/throws him when he starts fighting with others to protect him from himself. Along with Mikasa, he tends to spend his free time with their mutual friend, Armin.

His father is a doctor (whom is well respected by Hannes and potentially many more) whilst his mother is a housewife."""^^rdfs:Literal .

Height: 5'9\" (175.3 cm)

Originally named Kakarot, Gokuu is born a member of a race of extraterrestrials called the Saiyans. Shortly following his birth, Gokuu is sent from his native planet Vegeta to Earth, for potential selling on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life; Goku was also sent away to escape Freeza's genocide of the Saiyans. Once he lands on Earth, he is adopted by an old man named Gohan (who is later just called Grandpa Gohan). At first, Goku is very violent as a kid due to his Saiyan blood, but due to an injury to his head that caused him severe amnesia, Gokuu changes to a more tempered, innocent boy. At the start of the series, Gokuu meets Bulma, Yamucha, Oolong, and Pu'ar, whose characters mirror those found in Wu Cheng'en's Journey to the West. He also encounters Kuririn, who eventually becomes his best friend, and others during his journey for more strength. Participating in several World Martial Arts Tournaments, Gokuu also battles foes-turned-allies such as Tenshinhan and Chaozu, as well as the offspring of Demon King Piccolo named Majunior (later, he's named just Piccolo).

Dragon Ball Z takes place 5 years after Gokuu's victory against Piccolo in the 23rd Budokai Tenkaichi. He now has a son named Son Gohan (named after Grandpa Gohan) who lacks his father's love of fighting but has a great hidden potential himself. Throughout the series, Gokuu & Gohan face terribly strong opponents like other powerful Saiyans, a space tyrant, artificial humans, Majins & Gods that threaten Earth while also giving them exhilarating fights. Along with new enemies, they also gain new friends that help in these situations. As well as becoming more powerful, Gokuu learns to accept his forgotten Saiyan heritage (this gives him a small identity crisis when Raditz reveals his past, and is something he carries with him into the proceeding Namek arc) & consistently comes across the predicament of killing an opponent (he starts out killing without much thought to the moral consequences of taking a life, and only after training under Kami does he start to struggle with killing a person; this comes to a head when he fights Freeza on Namek).""" .

Gokuu happens to be in possession of a dragon ball, but unfortunately for Bulma, he refuses to part ways with it, so she makes him a deal: he can tag along on her journey if he lets her borrow the dragon ball's power. With that, the two set off on the journey of a lifetime.

They don't go on the journey alone. On the way, they meet the old Muten-Roshi and wannabe disciple Kuririn, with whom Gokuu trains to become a stronger martial artist for the upcoming World Martial Arts Tournament. However, it's not all fun and games; the ability to make any wish come true is a powerful one, and there are others who would do much worse than just wishing for a boyfriend. To stop those who would try to abuse the legendary power, they train to become stronger fighters, using their newfound strength to help the people around them along the way.""" .

               dct:description """Five years after winning the World Martial Arts tournament, Gokuu is now living a peaceful life with his wife and son. This changes, however, with the arrival of a mysterious enemy named Raditz who presents himself as Gokuu's long-lost brother. He reveals that Gokuu is a warrior from the once powerful but now virtually extinct Saiyan race, whose homeworld was completely annihilated. When he was sent to Earth as a baby, Gokuu's sole purpose was to conquer and destroy the planet; but after suffering amnesia from a head injury, his violent and savage nature changed, and instead was raised as a kind and well-mannered boy, now fighting to protect others.

With his failed attempt at forcibly recruiting Gokuu as an ally, Raditz warns Gokuu's friends of a new threat that's rapidly approaching Earth—one that could plunge Earth into an intergalactic conflict and cause the heavens themselves to shake. A war will be fought over the seven mystical dragon balls, and only the strongest will survive in Dragon Ball Z.""" .

When the deaf Shouko Nishimiya transfers into his class, Shouya and the rest of his class thoughtlessly bully her for fun. However, when her mother notifies the school, he is singled out and blamed for everything done to her. With Shouko transferring out of the school, Shouya is left at the mercy of his classmates. He is heartlessly ostracized all throughout elementary and middle school, while teachers turn a blind eye.

Now in his third year of high school, Shouya is still plagued by his wrongdoings as a young boy. Sincerely regretting his past actions, he sets out on a journey of redemption: to meet Shouko once more and make amends.

Koe no Katachi tells the heartwarming tale of Shouya's reunion with Shouko and his honest attempts to redeem himself, all while being continually haunted by the shadows of his past.""" .

What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal Titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.

After witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Eren, his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman, and his childhood friend Armin Arlert join the brutal war against the Titans and race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are breached.""" .

Eren Jaeger, of the town called the Shiganshina District, wishes to see the outside world by joining the Scout Regiment, as he likens living in the cities to livestock. Despite this, his friend Mikasa Ackermann and their mother Carla Jaeger are against him joining the Scouts. Even after seeing the Scouts return home with large casualties, Eren expresses his interest to join, which impresses his father Grisha Jaeger, who promises to show him what lies in their basement once he returns. After Eren and Mikasa rescue their friend Armin Arlert from a group of delinquents, the Colossal Titan, a 60m Titan, suddenly appears and knocks down the gate to the Shiganshina District, which lies in the outer edge of Wall Maria, allowing smaller Titans to enter. As the town erupts into mass panic, Eren and Mikasa rush back to their house, only to see Carla pinned under their collapsed house. As a Smiling Titan approaches them, Carla begs them to flee, but they refuse until city guard Hannes arrives and assures them that he will defend them. However, as he charges towards the Titan, he is overcome with fear and takes Eren and Mikasa away. Eren watches in horror as a Smiling Titan eats Carla." .

Some of townsfolk of the Shiganshina District escape to the inner Wall Maria, while the soldiers try to hold off the Titans. The soldiers try to close the gate, but the Armored Titan rams the gate, breaching the inner Wall Maria, and causing those inside to retreat even further inside Wall Rose. Some time later, Eren has a strange dream in which his grieving father forcefully gives him an injection and his key before being woken up by Mikasa. Eren grows disgusted with the people of Wall Rose as the latter do not like sharing their food or homes with the refugees. During the next year, as a food shortage becomes apparent, the government orders the refugees to either work on the farms or fight to reclaim Wall Maria. About 250,000 people, 20% of the populace, choose to fight, only to be wiped out by the Titans. Eren vows revenge and joins the army along with Mikasa and Armin." .

The recruits train on an omni-directional mobility gear[10] apparatus, where they have to balance themselves while suspended on cables. After Eren has trouble balancing, he asks Reiner Braun and Bertholdt Hoover for help and discover they too are among the few who have personally encountered Titans. The next day, Eren balances on the apparatus but falls, but Keith discovers that Eren's apparatus was defective and passes him after a retry with different equipment." .

                             dct:description """For centuries, humanity has been hunted by giant, mysterious predators known as the Titans. Three mighty walls—Wall Maria, Rose, and Sheena—provided peace and protection for humanity for over a hundred years. That peace, however, was shattered when the Colossal Titan and Armored Titan appeared and destroyed the outermost wall, Wall Maria. Forced to retreat behind Wall Rose, humanity waited with bated breath for the Titans to reappear and destroy their safe haven once more.

In Shingeki no Kyojin Season 2, Eren Yeager and others of the 104th Training Corps have just begun to become full members of the Survey Corps. As they ready themselves to face the Titans once again, their preparations are interrupted by the invasion of Wall Rose—but all is not as it seems as more mysteries are unraveled. As the Survey Corps races to save the wall, they uncover more about the invading Titans and the dark secrets of their own members.""" .

Pastor Nick of the Wall Cult appears, urging them to cover it from sunlight. After the Titan is covered with sheets, Nick refuses to tell Hange why it is there, even after she threatens to kill him. She suspects that more titans are hidden within the walls. Meanwhile, Erwin is informed that Wall Rose was breached and Titans are roaming inside. 12 hours earlier, the rest of the 104th Trainees are stationed at an outpost when Titans are seen advancing from the south. Mike Zacharias orders the soldiers and trainees to spread out and inform the nearby villages and the capital about the Titans while he stays behind to delay them. In Stohess, Eren wakes up with Mikasa at his bedside and Armin tells them the Titans have breached Wall Rose. Back at the outpost, Mike buys enough time and prepares to escape, but is captured by a mysterious ape-like Titan covered in fur that is capable of speaking. The Beast Titan inquires about his three-dimensional maneuvering equipment (立体機動装置 Rittai kidō sōchi), but Mike does not answer, so the Titan strips Mike of his gear and leaves him to be eaten by the other Titans.

Meanwhile, Sasha rushes to warn her father and her village. She arrives to find the entire village deserted except for a woman being eaten by a Titan, and her daughter nearby in a state of shock. Sasha takes the girl and flees but they are chased by the Titan. Sasha decides to stay and fight while urging the girl to run away. Sasha succeeds in blinding the Titan with her arrows just as a group of villagers, including her father and the girl, return to pick her up. Meanwhile, Connie arrives at his village, only to find that it had already been attacked by Titans. Upon reaching his house, Connie discovers a Titan on its back trapped inside. He and the others wonder how it got so far from the walls when its short, thin legs seem too weak to support its body. (Source: Wikipedia)" .

Elsewhere, Christa Lenz tells Ymir not to worry about her when the latter asks Nanaba and Henning to allow the two to leave their group. Both groups eventually meet up at nighttime, discovering that no breaches occurred at the walls and deciding to rest up at Castle Utgard. Meanwhile, Eren Jaeger learns from Hange he could learn how to seal the breach in the Shiganshina District, seeing as the crystallized skin from Annie Leonhart as the Female Titan is the same material from the walls. Pastor Nick eventually reveals to Hange that Christa is the key to finding all the answers. Soon after, Sasha arrives and hands Hange a scroll from Erwin, advising Hange and the Scouts to head to Castle Utgard. In the meantime, the Beast Titan leads the other Titans to attack Castle Utgard. This prompts Nanaba, Henning, Lynne and Gelgar to defend the 104th Cadets." .

Conny mentions that the Titan he encountered at Ragako resembled his mother, but Ymir plays it off. Reiner Braun becomes suspicious when Ymir is able to read the unknown language on a food can labeled herring. The Titans soon appear, and the senior soldiers hold them off from the outside while the 104th Cadets defend themselves against smaller Titans that have breached the castle. In the process, Reiner has his arm badly injured after it is bitten by a Titan. After clearing the area of Titans, the Beast Titan throws chunks of Wall Rose at the castle, killing the group's horses. A second wave of Titans subsequently attack the castle, and the senior soldiers are soon overwhelmed and killed. As the Titans surround the tower which the unarmed 104th Cadets are on, Ymir jumps off the tower and transforms into a Titan in order to honor a promise that she made with Christa." .
